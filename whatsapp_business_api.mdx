###  How to make the transition from WhatsApp App to WhatsApp Business API and vice versa?

Any phone number can be upgraded to WhatsApp Business API provided the number isn’t active on any of the WhatsApp Apps. So, if a number is registered on WhatsApp App and one needs to get the API on the same number, the WhatsApp Account must be deleted. 

 

Note - If you don't wish to use WhatsApp Business API, you can downgrade the number & restore it back to WhatsApp Apps.
